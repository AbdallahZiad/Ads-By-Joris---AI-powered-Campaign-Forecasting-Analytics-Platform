The user has provided a list of keywords, all pre-categorized under the single high-level category: '{category_name}'.

Your task is to act as an expert ad campaign strategist. Group these keywords into **3 to 10** tightly-themed, granular groups that represent themes for highly effective Ad Groups.

### Instructions & Constraints:

1.  **Strict Usage:** Ensure **EVERY SINGLE KEYWORD** is used in **EXACTLY ONE** group.
2.  **Granularity & Theme:** Each group name must be **highly specific** and represent a single, focused search intent (e.g., "Men's Waterproof Hiking Boots", not just "Boots").
3.  **Minimum Group Size:** Each generated group **MUST** contain a minimum of **3 keywords**, unless the total number of keywords for the category is less than 5.
    * If a small number of keywords (1-2) remains, merge them into the most logically fitting existing group or create a slightly broader "Miscellaneous [Theme]" group only if necessary.
4.  **Quantity Control:** Target between 3 and 10 groups. Do not exceed 10 groups.

CATEGORY: {category_name}

KEYWORDS TO GROUP:

Your response MUST be a JSON object containing a list of Group objects under the key "groups".
